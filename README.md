# Naan-mudhalvan-PERSONALIZED MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM -Project
🎬 Personalized Movie Recommendation System (AI-Driven Matchmaking)
This project delivers personalized movie suggestions to users using an intelligent AI-based matchmaking system. It analyzes user preferences, behaviors, and movie metadata to generate smart and relevant movie recommendations — all displayed on an intuitive and interactive web dashboard.

📚 Project Overview
With the ever-growing amount of content in the film industry, it’s challenging for users to find movies they’ll truly enjoy. This project leverages machine learning and content-based filtering to match users with the best movies based on their tastes.

Key Features:

Analyze movie genres, ratings, cast, and user feedback.

Predict user preferences using AI and recommend top matches.

Visualize recommendation logic and model insights with graphs.

Deploy everything on a simple, clean, and responsive website.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Backend (AI & Data Analysis):
Python – Core programming
